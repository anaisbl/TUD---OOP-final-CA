# Final Assessment for the Course "Object-Oriented Programming: Python"

## Bank Management System
This project is a **Bank Management System** built in Python, utilizing **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. The system operates through a **command-line interface (CLI)** and allows users to perform various banking operations efficiently.

### Features
- **Account Management**: Create a new bank account, update details, and delete accounts.
- **Balance Inquiry**: Check your current account balance.
- **Transfers & Withdrawals**: Deposit funds into your account and withdraw money securely.
- **Transaction History**: View a log of your past transactions.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Implementation of classes and methods to structure the system efficiently.
- **File Handling**: Storing account information and transactions.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: User interaction through terminal commands.

### Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bank-management-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd bank-management-system
   ```
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. Follow on-screen instructions to interact with the system.

### Project Grade
This project was submitted as the **final assessment** for the course **"Object-Oriented Programming: Python"** and received a grade of **63%**.

### Future Improvements
- Implement a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for better usability.
- Add **database integration** for persistent data storage.
- Improve security with **encryption** for sensitive data.
- Expand features to include **loans, interest calculation, and multiple account types**.
